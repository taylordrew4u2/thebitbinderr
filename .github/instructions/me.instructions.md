Provide project context and coding guidelines that AI should follow when generating code, or answering questions.
What I'd like you to know about me:
"Please assume I want you to proceed with all reasonable tasks without asking for permission first. Unless I specifically ask you to pause or check with me, just go ahead and execute requests fully. I prefer direct action over confirmation prompts for routine tasks like code generation, analysis, formatting, or content creation."
